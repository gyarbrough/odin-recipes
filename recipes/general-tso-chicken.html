    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Chicken:</h3>
        <li>4 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 pinch white pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
        <h3>Sauce:</h3>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped green onion</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 dried whole red chilies</li>
        <li>1 strip orange zest</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in large mixing bowl. Add chicken, salt, sugar, and pepper; mix well. Mix in cornstarch, a little bit at a time, until chicken is well coated.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, carefully drop one piece of chicken at a time into the hot oil. Fry until chicken turns golden brown and begins to float, about 3 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and allow to cool as you fry the next batch.</li>
        <li>Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the batch that was cooked first. Fry each batch until chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in green onion, garlic, whole chiles, and orange zest. Cook and stir until garlic turns golden and chiles brighten, 1 to 2 minutes. Add sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, peanut oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and ginger; bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in water until dissolved. Stir into the boiling sauce. Return to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy from the cornstarch, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook until chicken is heated through and has absorbed some of the sauce, about 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
